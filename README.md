# SmoothingProject
A presentation on smoothing. This is a presentation and report I submitted for the class MATH 542D at CSUN. The topic for the semester was statistical computing. 

The presentation focuses mostly on linear smoothers which can be written as a linear function of the data. Some theory and notation is introduced in the first few slides. After that a definition of linear smoothers. An example is given with the running average being represented as a matrix operation. The presentation also discusses bias-variance trade off, cross-validation, and quick introductions to other types of smoothers.
